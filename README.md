## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned
-Learnt the Use case of "row-gap"
-letter spacing


### Continued development
- I'm having issues with mobile-first workflow, so I'll be practicing it, from now henceforth, till I get a full grasp of it.

### Useful resources

- [Letter spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) - This helped understand Letter spacing
- [row gaps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/row-gap) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand row-gap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
